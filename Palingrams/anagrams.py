 Idea is to get an input name and generate anagrame phrase out of it;
 we don't really care about valid english phrase but we do care about words being valid english words.

 - idea is to get a string and then repeat the following process
 - process the dictionary and have them sorted letters pointing to possible words
 - pick letters from the input and form valid words
 - repeat the process until all letters are exhausted
